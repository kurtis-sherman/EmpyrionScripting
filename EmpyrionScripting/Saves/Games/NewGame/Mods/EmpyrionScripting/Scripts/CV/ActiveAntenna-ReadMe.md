1. Place an Antenna Decoration Block (ID:1877,1878,1879,1880,1880,1881,1882,1883,1884)
1. Use 'di' to determine its position
1. Place an LCD and name it as follows (Note: LCDSize and ScrollLines are optional)
```
EnemyScan=[X,Y,Z]=[LCDSize]=[ScrollLines]
```
for example:
if the antenna block is at position 1,137,0, the LCD should have a font size of 50% and scroll after 100 lines.
```
EnemyScan=1,137,0=50%=100
```
